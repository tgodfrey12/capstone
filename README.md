Find A Mentor

<B>Why I did it</B>

I wanted to do a project putting together the front end knowledge I have gained at Galvanize while using the middle and 
back end C#/.NET I had used in previous lives.  I used .NET core 1.1 on a mac with a Sqlite database and Entity Frameworks,
and ASP.NET core.

<B>Challenges</B>

Using a newer framework (.NET core) on an operating system it is newly compatible with (Apple OS X) and finding a database
that would work with both (Postgres did not work).
